# R10.1 / ARV-003 — Production LLM Analysis

Status: `R10_1_GATE_5_CONTROLLED_ACCEPTANCE_COMPLETE` (reconciled 2026-09-20 from merged acceptance evidence; historical Gate 1–4 text below is retained).

Canonical base: annotated tag `r9-operational-hardening-2026-07-24`, peeled commit `58bef2da2342bff1e6f63215ee2697e96fefe6f7`.

Architecture contract: `docs/reviews/r10-1-production-llm-architecture-audit-20260725.md`.

## Definition of done

ARV-003 is complete when one configured real provider processes a controlled real procurement through a versioned R10.1 producer and produces a canonical-compatible result where:

- every accepted factual conclusion resolves to evidence owned by the procurement;
- confidence is assigned by a deterministic grounding policy rather than trusted from the provider;
- provider/model/prompt/schema/evidence/policy identities are recorded;
- provider failure, invalid output, unsupported claims and budget exhaustion fail closed;
- token, latency and cost measurements are captured against explicit budgets;
- no stub or synthetic positive output is used in production mode;
- R8/R9 snapshot, hash, ownership, idempotency and final-PDF contracts remain unchanged;
- sanitized executable evidence is published for the real run.

Status: `R10_1_GATE_3_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_TRANSPORT_COMPLETE`.

### Gate 4 — versioned R10.1 canonical producer

- [x] add `produce_r10_1_canonical_analysis()` beside `produce_frozen_canonical_analysis()`;
- [x] keep the frozen producer unchanged and prove byte-equivalent explicit dispatch;
- [x] build deterministic evidence packets only from server-owned analyzed documents;
- [x] validate tenant/project/case/run/registry identities before provider invocation;
- [x] pass only validated supported claims through an explicit field-path allow-list;
- [x] reject unknown fields, malformed values, mixed supported/rejected results and provider-authored positive decisions;
- [x] preserve existing source graph construction, canonical serialization and verification;
- [x] record provider/model/prompt/schema/evidence/policy/budget provenance without raw response bodies;
- [x] make `frozen_r9` versus `production_llm_r10_1` mode selection explicit and prohibit fallback;
- [x] prove provider failure and grounding failure cannot publish canonical files;
- [x] remain fully offline through fake-provider tests.

Status: `R10_1_GATE_4_VERSIONED_CANONICAL_PRODUCER_COMPLETE`.

### Gate 5 — controlled real-provider evidence

- [x] select and approve one configured provider/model and versioned pricing policy;
- [x] load credentials only from the existing secret/config boundary and prove they never enter requests, results, logs or artifacts;
- [x] run one approved real procurement through `production_llm_r10_1`;
- [x] verify every accepted claim against procurement-owned evidence and preserve rejected claims/limitations;
- [x] record provider/model/request/prompt/schema/evidence/grounding/pricing identities;
- [x] record token usage, retries, latency and cost against explicit budgets;
- [x] prove provider, validation and budget failures remain fail closed without frozen or stub fallback;
- [x] publish sanitized runtime evidence without raw tender text, raw provider bodies or credentials;
- [x] repeat the same controlled input to verify stable local identities and non-conflicting publication.

Gate 5 is the first gate allowed to use one approved real credential, endpoint and procurement. It must be executed as a controlled evidence run, not as general customer rollout.

Acceptance reconciliation (2026-09-20): Gate 5 was accepted in issue #68 on merged commit `f96e3588f2e1f61f19d54e44594debfc81a745bf`. Repository-owned downstream runbooks record `ARV003_GATE5_CONTROLLED_ACCEPTANCE_COMPLETE`, two executions, repeat identity verification, 25 batches, 20 accepted claims, zero rejected/unsupported claims, zero retries, no raw provider response storage and zero external cost. This update records existing accepted evidence only; it does not rerun the provider or mutate the accepted bundle.

### Gate 6 — handoff to ARV-001

- [x] provide R10.1 evidence to the golden report and release-gate work;
- [ ] do not begin ARV-004 self-improvement or ARV-005 pilot expansion before ARV-001 acceptance criteria are defined.

## Non-goals

- no source graph redesign;
- no R8/R9 artifact-contract redesign;
- no new UI;
- no deployment;
- no 223-FZ;
- no provider marketplace or multi-provider benchmark;
- no Hermes customer-scoped memory/self-improvement work;
- no autonomous external action;
- no broad refactor of unrelated historical LLM code.

## Immediate next slice

Gate 5 is the only authorized implementation slice. It must execute one approved real-provider procurement analysis through the versioned R10.1 producer, produce sanitized evidence for grounding and budgets, and preserve every fail-closed and immutable-publication invariant established in Gates 2–4.
